$MRN is the official token of MoreNFT. It is a deflationary asset that promotes a higher value as the total
supply of the token decreases through a token burn series.

On the first sale of each NFT in the Factory, a portion of the sales (5%), charged to the artist, will be burned
in order to reduce MRN's total supply.

For each trade on the marketplace, 0.25% of the sales volume will be burned.

$MRN is an ERC-20 token based on Ethereum's mainnet, which makes it easy to leverage the wide range of
Layer-2 solutions including Polygon.

Uniswap is the DEX that will be used for the first liquidity launch. The latter uses an automated market maker
model (AMM), where you trade within a liquidity pool.
