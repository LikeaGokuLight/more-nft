> ### **MRN** is the official token of MoreNFT.

**MRN** is a **deflationary token** that promotes a higher value as the total supply of the token decreases through a token burn series.

ðŸ¦„ðŸ”¥ **Factory Burn**
On the first sale of each NFT in the Factory, a portion of the sales (5%), charged to the artist, will be burned in order to reduce MRN's total supply.

ðŸ›’ðŸ”¥ **Marketplace Burn**
For each trade on the marketplace, 0.25% of the sales volume will be burned.

**MRN** is an ERC-20 token based on Ethereum's mainnet, which makes it easy to leverage the wide range of Layer-2 solutions including Polygon.

The Uniswap DEX will be used for the first liquidity launch. It uses an automated market make model (AMM), where users trade through a liquidity pool.
