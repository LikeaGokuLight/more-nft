## ðŸ‘¥ Using Typesense DocSearch

**Typesense**d DocSearch works similar to Algolia DocSearch, except that your website is indexed into a Typesense search cluster.

Typesense is an open source instant-search engine that you can either:

- Self-Host on your own servers or
- Use the Managed Typesense Cloud service.
- Similar to Algolia DocSearch, there are two components:

typesense-docsearch-scraper - which scrapes your website and indexes the data in your Typesense cluster.

docusaurus-theme-search-typesense - a search bar UI component to add to your website.
### Read a step-by-step walk-through of how to run typesense-docsearch-scraper here and how to install the Search Bar in your Docusaurus Site here.
