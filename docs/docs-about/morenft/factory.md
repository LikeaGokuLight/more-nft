## Origins

The name comes from Andy Warhol's creative studio founded in New York City in 1962. The studio was a
meeting place for famous artists and emerging faces. It was called "The Factory" because it was considered
a magical place to develop projects and produce new ideas.

Sixty years later, we are here to offer you that atmosphere, where the union brings benefits to the whole
community.

## An exclusive market

The Factory is MoreNFT's exclusive market where projects and collections produced by Content Creators,
Brands and Stars will be launched, once validated by our Project Recruiting team.

The Factory aims to ensure the authenticity and uniqueness of the projects within it. Each creator, by filling
out the verification form, will be able to get the authenticity checkmark for his profile.

Once the profile is verified, the user who wants to create works within our exclusive marketplace can submit
his project to our team for approval.

After a team verification, roadmap and project intent, MoreNFT guarantees to the community the validity of
the projects presented. Projects launched through the Factory won’t have to worry about copy collections
trying to scam newcomers, as they will have a dedicated page and our MoreNFT certified mold.

Verified users who want to give their project a boost can take advantage of some additional services such as
custom in-platform banners or a dedicated paid advertising service. It is possible to have advantage of these
services without incurring an initial cost. The platform, in agreement with the creator, will be entitled to a
portion of the creator fees, measured according to the support provided.

Verified artists can be selected by the MoreNFT team to be involved in initiatives and projects under the
name "MoreNFT Original" in partnership with brands or stars that will join our community. In this case the
MoreNFT team is an active part of the process taking care of all the activities required for the success of the
project.
