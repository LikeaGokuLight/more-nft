## 🎈💐 Origins

The name comes from Andy Warhol's creative studio founded in New York City in 1962. The studio was a meeting place for famous artists and emerging faces. It was called "**The Factory**" because it was considered a **magical place to develop projects and produce new ideas**.

Sixty years later, we are here to offer you that atmosphere, where the union **brings benefits to the whole community**.

## 🦄 🛒 An exclusive market

**The Factory is MoreNFT's exclusive market** where projects and collections produced by Content Creators, Brands and Stars will be launched, once validated by our Project Recruiting team.

The Factory aims to **guarantee the authenticity and uniqueness** of its projects, to avoid copy collections trying to scam newcomers.

In the Factory we also provide a **range of additional services** for users who want to boost their projects. It is possible to have advantage of these services **without incurring an initial cost**. The platform, in agreement with the creator, will be entitled to a portion of the creator fees, measured according to the support provided.

Verified artists can be selected by the MoreNFT team to be involved in initiatives and projects under the name "**MoreNFT Original**" in partnership with brands or stars that will join our community. In this case, the MoreNFT team takes an active role in the activities required to make the project successful.
