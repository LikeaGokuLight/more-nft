MoreNFT pursues the great goal of being a platform that wants to give its users a voice. For this reason, the
team is working to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

Users will have the ability to make important decisions on the future of the platform, approving new
initiative/projects and by electing new Brand Ambassadors. This will allow you to better transmit and transfer
the vision of community economy. In this way, MRN will become a governance token necessary for the
approval of the DAO's initiatives.

The DAO will allow users to be active players in the decision-making processes of the platform, deciding the
fate of the tokens allocated to the Foundation for the development and growth of the entire MoreNFT
ecosystem.

In contradiction with the Factory, in which the publication of content is not free to all, in this section of the
platform, users will be able to submit their creations to the judgement of the community or vote on the
proposals of other users through MRN. The most voted proposal will actually become an NFT that will be
launched in Factory.
