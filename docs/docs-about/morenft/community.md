### The ultimate goal for MorenNFT is to give its users a voice. To achieve this goal, the team is working to create a üë•üë• **Decentralized Autonomous Organization** (DAO)

Users will have the ability to **make important decisions on the future of the platform**, approving new initiative/projects and by electing new **Brand Ambassadors**.  In this way, MRN will become a governance token necessary for the approval of the DAO's initiatives and will enable **our community economy vision** .

Through the DAO, **users will be active players** in the decision-making processes of the platform, deciding the fate of the tokens allocated to the **Foundation** for the **development and growth of the entire MoreNFT ecosystem**.

In contrast with the Factory, where publishing content is not free to everyone, in the **Community** section, users will be able to **submit their creations** to the judgement of the community or **vote on the proposals of other users through MRN**. The **most voted proposal will actually become an üñºÔ∏è NFT that will be launched in Factory.**
