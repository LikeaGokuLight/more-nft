Until now, the word NFT has often been associated with the speculative effect behind digital works of art.
According to the Financial Times, it is not all about the world of art and collectibles, in fact NFTs are a form
of certification applicable to any type of digital or physical object. In the next few years, the real challenge of
the main marketplaces will be the ability to focus attention on the different use cases of Non-FungibleTokens, highlighting the need to guide and educate new users in the immediate future.

## Visibility is an almost unattainable goal

The entire Non-Fungible-Token supply chain has an extreme need to protect the Early adopters of this technology.

With the improvement of standards for issuing NFTs, over the last year, the entry barriers have reduced
significantly. The reduction of some obstacles and the introduction of novelties such as the free-mint, have
generated an enormous growth of interest in this new market, attracting new operators eager to grab a small
slice of the volumes by creating their own works.

The ease with which it is now possible to create a new NFT collection, combined with the opportunity to raise
large funds, has led to an overcrowding of projects on the various marketplaces.

The projects that manage to emerge and stand out in this open sea are those that make important marketing
campaigns in order to make themselves known by the communities. Marketing, therefore, plays a main role
in obtaining visibility and has now become fundamental and a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to bring a project to success.

## The Future of Marketplaces

All the largest NFT marketplaces are managed directly by a company that collects all the profits from the
volumes in its secondary market. So, while the cryptocurrency community, and in particular the one of NFTs,
is a completely decentralized community, we cannot say the same about NFT marketplaces. Once more
public marketplaces are launched, the competition will focus on the additional services that these
marketplaces will be able to offer their users.

It is in fact possible to launch a marketplace governed, in a total or partial way, by a Decentralized
Autonomous Organization (DAO), whose decisions will be proposed and adopted by the holders of the
platform's native token. Through the release of a governance token, it would be possible to achieve greater
interaction with the community, opening the doors to many other perspectives, such as the distribution of
profits in a more equitable way.

In this way it is possible to create a decentralized NFT market, without only the companies making the
decisions, but leaving much more importance to the community itself.
