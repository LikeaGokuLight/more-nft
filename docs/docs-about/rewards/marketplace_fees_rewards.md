## Marketplace Fee Rewards

For trades in **WETH** on the Ethereum network, MoreNFT is charging a sales commission of 1.75%, out
of which **1% is distributed to MRN stakers every 24 hours**:

- Rewards are in **WETH**;
- Release occurs **linearly every 24 hours**;
- **Distributed to MRN stakers**;
- **Fee Rewards do not expire**, so users can make the claim at any time;

The calculation of market fee rewards takes into account only the **total MRN staked**.

*For MRN trades on both Ethereum and Polygon and for WETH sales only on Polygon, the platform does not distribute marketplace fees to stakers.*
