## Marketplace fees rewards

For sales conducted in WETH on Ethereum network, MoreNFT is charging a sales commission of 1.75%, out
of which 1% is distributed to MRN stakers every 24 hours:

- Rewards are in WETH;
- The release is done in a linear format every 24 hours;
- Are distributed to MRN stakers;
- Fee rewards do not expire so you could claim at any time you want.

The calculation of market fee rewards takes into account only the total MRN staked.

For MRN sales on both Ethereum and Polygon and for WETH sales only on Polygon, the platform does not
distribute marketplace fees to stakers.

## Trading Rewards
Users who trade any NFTs on the MoreNFT Marketplace earn trading rewards in MRN.

Both the buyer and seller of an item earn rewards for their trading volume.

In order to get trading rewards, it is necessary that the trades, both with MRN and WETH, are on Ethereum
network. Trading rewards are not available for trades on Polygon network.

Trading rewards are calculated daily and will be earned over 5 phases with differing rewards rates:

| **Tier** | **Total MRN** | **Lenght** | **MRN per day** |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1        | 9.628.080     | 1 (mese)   | 320.936         |
| 2        | 12.843.600    | 3 (mesi)   | 142.707         |
| 3        | 14.426.720    | 8 (mesi)   | 60.111          |
| 4        | 11.519.200    | 12 (mesi)  | 31.998          |
| 5        | 13.182.400    | 10 (mesi)  | 43.941          |

Every day, trading rewards are calculated based on each user's trading volume on MoreNFT as a percentage
of the total platform trading volume, excluding the volumes generated in the Factory

Trading rewards are awarded as follows:

$$
User\ Alpha’s\ trading\ rewards\ on\ Day\ 1\ {x \over y} \times z
$$

Where:

x = User’s Alpha trading volume during Day 1;

y = Total trading volume generated on the MoreNFT Marketplace by all users;

z = MRN trading rewards on day 1.

Example:

- John traded a volume of $1,000 using both WETH and MRN;
- The total volume traded, both in WETH and MRN, on the Marketplace on day 1 was $10,000.

$$
Jhon’s\ trading\ rewards\ on\ Day\ 1\ {1.000 \over 10.000} \times 320.936
$$

All collections available on the MoreNFT Marketplace are eligible for trading rewards.

## Staking Rewards
