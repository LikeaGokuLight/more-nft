## Marketplace fees rewards

For sales conducted in WETH on Ethereum network, MoreNFT is charging a sales commission of 1.75%, out
of which 1% is distributed to MRN stakers every 24 hours:

- Rewards are in WETH;
- The release is done in a linear format every 24 hours;
- Are distributed to MRN stakers;
- Fee rewards do not expire so you could claim at any time you want.

The calculation of market fee rewards takes into account only the total MRN staked.

For MRN sales on both Ethereum and Polygon and for WETH sales only on Polygon, the platform does not
distribute marketplace fees to stakers.
