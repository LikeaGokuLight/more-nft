### **Users who trade any NFTs on the MoreNFT Marketplace earn trading rewards in MRN**

Both the buyer and seller of an item earn rewards for their trading volume.

In order to get trading rewards, **it is necessary that the trades are on the Ethereum network**. Trading rewards are not available for trades on Polygon network.

**Trading rewards are calculated daily** and will be earned **over 5 phases** with differing rewards rates:

| **Tier** | **Total MRN** | **Lenght** | **MRN per day** |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1        | 9.628.080     | 1 (month)   | 320.936         |
| 2        | 12.843.600    | 3 (months)   | 142.707         |
| 3        | 14.426.720    | 8 (months)   | 60.111          |
| 4        | 11.519.200    | 12 (months)  | 31.998          |
| 5        | 13.182.400    | 10 (months)  | 43.941          |

Every day, trading rewards are **calculated based on each user's trading volume on MoreNFT as a percentage of the total platform trading volume**, excluding the volumes generated in the Factory

Trading rewards are awarded as follows:

$$
User\ Alpha’s\ trading\ rewards\ on\ Day\ 1\ {x \over y} \times z
$$

Where:

x = User’s Alpha trading volume during Day 1;

y = Total trading volume generated on the MoreNFT Marketplace by all users;

z = MRN trading rewards on day 1.

Example:

- John traded a volume of $1,000 using both WETH and MRN;
- The total volume traded, both in WETH and MRN, on the Marketplace on day 1 was $10,000.

$$
Jhon’s\ trading\ rewards\ on\ Day\ 1\ {1.000 \over 10.000} \times 320.936
$$

**All collections available on the MoreNFT Marketplace are eligible for trading rewards.**
