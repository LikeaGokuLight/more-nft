Each user can stake their tokens in order to get rewards in MRN.

MRN staking rewards will be earned over 5 phases with differing rewards rates:

| **Tier** | **Total MRN** | **Lenght** | **MRN per day** |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1        | 4.143.520     | 1 (mese)   | 138.117         |
| 2        | 6.642.400     | 3 (mesi)   | 73.804          |
| 3        | 6.812.640     | 8 (mesi)   | 28.386          |
| 4        | 6.301.920     | 12 (mesi)  | 17.505          |
| 5        | 6.499.520     | 12(mesi)   | 18.054          |

User's staking rewards will be proportional to the amount of MRN they have staked, relative to all other
stakers.

## Auto-compounding

Very often users who want to increase the number of tokens staked by reinvesting previously earned tokens
are forced to pay additional gas fees to add tokens to the staking pool. MoreNFT has enabled autocompounding for all users that stake MRN. This means all rewards earned from staking are automatically restaked into the pool in order to increase the amount of MRN
